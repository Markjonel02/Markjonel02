## Hi there! 👋

 A self-driven Frontend/Backend Developer from the Philippines with a passion for crafting interactive web experiences, building full-stack applications, and continuously learning new technologies.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm Mark, a passionate developer from the Philippines 🇵🇭 who enjoys turning ideas into functional and visually engaging digital experiences. With a love for both design and logic, I work across the full stack — from crafting responsive frontends to building robust backends.

🔭 I’m currently building exciting web apps and creative UI animations

🌱 Always learning: exploring modern frameworks like React, Vue, and animation libraries like GSAP

🧠 Curious by nature and driven by challenges

🤝 I love collaborating on meaningful, open-source, or experimental projects

🎯 Goal: to create impactful digital experiences that make people's lives better

When I’m not coding, I’m probably diving into tech videos, tweaking personal projects, or leveling up my skills through hands-on experimentation.
